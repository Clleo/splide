<!-- Thanks for the nice slider.

I would like to suggest that you rethink the approach to lazy loading of images.

1. The correct approach would be to keep the path to the original image.
that is, the <a> tag must have the src attribute.

(This is useful for SEO. Search engine spiders will find original images.)

2. To be able to place a SVG stub, it will serve as a preloader for the image, and will help to maintain the correct layout position.

An example of the most correctly configured lacy load

-->

<img class="lozad"
	srcset="/files/preload_250x400.svg"
	data-srcset="/files/image.jpg"
	src="/files/image.jpg"
	alt="Image" width="250" height="400">

<!-- One of the few existing correctly made lazy load scripts here -->

<a src="https://github.com/ApoorvSaxena/lozad.js">lozad.js</a>
